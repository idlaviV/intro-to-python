# Introduction to Python
For every session I provide scripts and exercises in two formats: there are two notebooks - one script and one containing the exercises:

## Session 4
Materials will be uploaded later today - check again tomorrow :D


## Session 3

### PIP
Open CMD/terminal/console and type `pip --version`. <br>
If you still/as well have python2 installed you might have to type `pip3`. <br>
Your output should look something like this: <br>
> pip 21.1.2 from /home/linuxbrew/.linuxbrew/Cellar/python@3.9/3.9.1_1/lib/python3.9/site-packages/pip (python 3.9)

[*See here on how to install pip if not installed*](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/install-pip-for-python/).

For this session we will need the `pandas` package.
Install using pip: 
`pip install pandas`

To install any other package: <br>
`pip install <package-name>`:
For notebooks use: `!pip install pandas`<br>

## General information
Here you can find all materials for the intro to python course.

If you are not familiar with GitHub, you can find an [introduction here](https://product.hubspot.com/blog/git-and-github-tutorial-for-beginners).
However, git will be no part of the course and will only serve as a hosting platform for all materials.
We will be talking about the GitHub repository and it's structure in the first session as well.
For now you can directly download the materials for the [first session here](https://github.com/MisterXY89/intro-to-python/archive/refs/heads/main.zip).


As a preparation, please download and install Python and Atom.
Choose the [latest 64bit version for your operating system here](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-396/).
Alternatively use the respective direct link:

- [Windows](https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.9.6/python-3.9.6-amd64.exe)
- [MacOS](https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.9.6/python-3.9.6-macos11.pkg)
- For Linux Systems follow [this guide](https://tecadmin.net/how-to-install-python-3-9-on-ubuntu-20-04/)


If there are any problems, don't worry. We will have time in the first session to address and solve them.
In the course itself we will probably use jupyter notebooks (Google Collab).
We will still talk about the installation and configuration of a development environment to get you all set for future coding.

As an editor I would recommend Atom. Which can be downloaded [here](https://atom.io/) (every other editor works as well if you have any preferences or favorites).
