# Introduction to Python
Here you can find all materials for the intro to python course.

If you are not familiar with GitHub, you can find an introduction [here](https://product.hubspot.com/blog/git-and-github-tutorial-for-beginners).
However, git will be no part of the course and will only serve as a hosting platform for all materials.
We will be talking about the GitHub repository and it's structure in the first session as well.
For now you can directly download the materials for the first session [here](https://github.com/MisterXY89/intro-to-python/archive/refs/heads/main.zip).


As a preparation, please download and install Python and Atom.
Choose the latest 64bit version for your operating system here https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-396/.
Alternatively use the respective direct link:

- [Windows](https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.9.6/python-3.9.6-amd64.exe)
- [MacOS](https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.9.6/python-3.9.6-macos11.pkg)
- For Linux Systems follow [this guide](https://tecadmin.net/how-to-install-python-3-9-on-ubuntu-20-04/)


If there are any problems, don't worry. We will have time in the first session to address and solve them.
In the course itself we will probably use jupyter notebooks (Google Collab).
We will still talk about the installation and configuration of a development environment to get you all set for future coding.

As an editor I would recommend Atom. Which can be downloaded [here](https://atom.io/) (every other editor works as well if you have any preferences or favorites).

The scripts for the first session can be found [here](https://github.com/MisterXY89/intro-to-python/tree/main/session_1).
For every session I provide scripts and exercises in two formats: there are two notebooks - one script and one containing the exercises and single files in the respective folders.
The script for session 1 can be found [here](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/16ORcXM3vurNakmwjL71yfgJg5yZRcGkh?usp=sharing).
The exercises are [here](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1Far5OmDTl9E64MoijVQH9XvzL9v-gPgW?usp=sharing).
