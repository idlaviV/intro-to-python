# Questions:
# (1)  What are common exception types?
# the most important ones we want to specifically fetch are:
# > KeyError (e.g. when accessing dictionary entries which do not exist)
# > IndexError (e.g. when accessing an element of a list by index > len(list))
# > FileNotFound (File not found while trying to read)


# (2) How to structure code over multiple files?
# > Use import filename -> will import all variables and functions
# -> example

# (3) What tools are there for testing python code?
# I have been using pytest (unit-testing), however there are also other libs
# like: unittest
